The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence
Agency (NGA) have collaborated on the development of a notably enhanced
global elevation model named the Global Multi-resolution Terrain
Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010) that replaces GTOPO30 as the elevation
dataset of choice for global and continental scale applications. Since
the time GTOPO30 was completed, the availability of higher-quality
elevation data over large geographic areas has improved markedly. New
data sources include global Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTEDÂ®)
from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Canadian elevation
data, Spot 5 Reference3D data, and data from the Ice, Cloud, and land
Elevation Satellite (ICESat). GMTED2010 provides a new level of detail in
global topographic data. The GMTED2010 product suite contains seven new
raster elevation products for each of the 30-, 15-, and 7.5-arc-second
spatial resolutions and incorporates the current best available global
elevation data. The new elevation products have been produced using the
following aggregation methods: minimum elevation, maximum elevation, mean
elevation, median elevation, standard deviation of elevation, systematic
subsample, and breakline emphasis. Metadata have also been produced to
identify the source and attributes of all the input elevation data used
to derive the output products. Many of these products will be suitable
for various regional continental-scale land cover mapping, extraction of
drainage features for hydrologic modeling, and geometric and radiometric
correction of medium and coarse resolution satellite image data.

The global aggregated vertical accuracy of GMTED2010 can be summarized in
terms of the resolution and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the products
with respect to a global set of control points (estimated global accuracy
of 6 m RMSE) provided by NGA. At 30 arc-seconds, the GMTED2010 RMSE range
is between 25 and 42 meters; at 15 arc-seconds, the RMSE range is between
29 and 32 meters; and at 7.5 arc-seconds, the RMSE range is between 26 and
30 meters. GMTED2010 is a major improvement in consistency and vertical
accuracy over GTOPO30, which has a 66 m RMSE globally compared to the
same NGA control points. In areas where new sources of higher resolution
data were available, the GMTED2010 products are substantially better
than the aggregated global statistics; however, large areas still exist,
particularly above 60 degrees North latitude that lack good elevation
data. As new data become available, especially in areas that have poor
coverage in the current model, it is hoped that new versions of GMTED2010
might be generated and thus gradually improve the global model.

GMTOPO30 is my processed version of the GMTED2010 30" mean-elevation
dataset.  The original is a monolithic DEM in the proprietary (and
horrible) ESRI Arc/Info Grid format, so I have broken it up into the
same tiles as used by GTOPO30, formatted a plain 16-bit integer rasters,
making it a drop-in replacement for GTOPO30.
