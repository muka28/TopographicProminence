Topographic Prominence Algorithm
CSC615: Computational Geometry Project

Project Overview
Objective: Compute the topographic prominence of peaks in a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and identify the 100 most prominent peaks along with their corresponding cols (saddle points).
Programming Language: Rust ðŸ¦€

What is Topographic Prominence?
Definition: The prominence of a peak is the minimum height one must descend when traveling from the summit to any higher peak, or to sea level if no higher peak exists.
Key Concepts:
* Peak: A point higher than all 8 neighboring points
* Col: The lowest point (saddle) on the optimal route to a higher peak
* Prominence = Peak Elevation - Col Elevation
Visual Example
    A(35)     D(32)
      |    /     |
      |   /      |
     (20)      (11)â”€â”€â”€ C(25)
      |           |
      |           |
   â”€â”€â”€0â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€(1)â”€â”€â”€ B(30)
   sea level

A: Prominence = 35 (highest peak, connects to sea level)
B: Prominence = 30 - 1 = 29 (col at elevation 1)
C: Prominence = 25 - 11 = 14 (col at elevation 11)

Algorithm Architecture
Core Data Structures
1. Point Structure
struct Point {
    elevation: i32,  // Height at this location
    x: usize,        // Row coordinate
    y: usize,        // Column coordinate  
    index: usize,    // Flattened array index
}
2. Peak Structure
struct Peak {
    prominence: i32,              // Calculated prominence
    peak_x: usize, peak_y: usize, // Peak coordinates
    peak_elevation: i32,          // Peak height
    col_x: Option<usize>,         // Col coordinates (if exists)
    col_y: Option<usize>,
    col_elevation: Option<i32>,   // Col height (if exists)
}
3. Union-Find Structure
struct UnionFind {
    parent: Vec<usize>,           // Parent pointers for tree structure
    rank: Vec<i32>,              // Tree depth for balanced merging
    highest_point: Vec<Point>,   // Highest point in each component
}

Algorithm Workflow
Step 1: Peak Identification 
* Scan entire grid (O(n) where n = total points)
* For each point, check all 8 neighbors
* Mark as peak if higher than ALL neighbors
* Uses 8-connectivity for thorough analysis
Step 2: Point Sorting 
* Sort ALL points by elevation (descending order)
* Custom Ord implementation for efficient sorting
* Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Step 3: Union-Find Initialization 
* Create disjoint set for each grid point
* Initialize with path compression and union-by-rank
* Track highest point in each connected component
Step 4: Sweep Algorithm 
FOR each point p (highest to lowest):
    1. Activate point p
    2. Check all 8 neighbors of p
    3. IF neighbor is already active:
        - Union p with neighbor
        - Calculate prominence if conditions met
        - Store result in max-heap
Step 5: Result Generation 
* Extract top 100 peaks from max-heap
* Sort by prominence (descending)
* Format output with peak and col information

âš¡ Key Optimizations
1. Union-Find with Path Compression
fn find(&mut self, x: usize) -> usize {
    if self.parent[x] != x {
        self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x]); // Path compression
    }
    self.parent[x]
}
* Benefit: Nearly constant time operations
* Improvement: Reduces tree height on subsequent finds
2. Union by Rank
if self.rank[root_x] < self.rank[root_y] {
    self.merge(root_x, root_y, col_point, peaks, peaks_set);
} else if self.rank[root_x] > self.rank[root_y] {
    self.merge(root_y, root_x, col_point, peaks, peaks_set);
}
* Benefit: Keeps union-find trees balanced
* Result: Logarithmic depth guarantee
3. Memory-Efficient Grid Storage
* Flat 1D Vector: Instead of 2D array of vectors
* Index Calculation: index = row * cols + col
* Memory Savings: Better cache locality, reduced allocations
4. Early Termination in Peak Detection
for neighbor in neighbors {
    if neighbor_elevation >= current_elevation {
        is_peak = false;
        break; // Early exit
    }
}

Complexity Analysis
Operation	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Peak Detection	O(n)	O(n)
Point Sorting	O(n log n)	O(1)
Union-Find Operations	O(n Î±(n))*	O(n)
Overall Algorithm	O(n log n)	O(n)
*Î±(n) = Inverse Ackermann function (effectively constant for practical inputs)
For a 6000Ã—4800 DEM (28.8M points):
* Expected Runtime: ~3-5 seconds
* Memory Usage: ~460 MB
* Scalability: Handles continent-sized datasets

File Format Support
CSV Format 
fn read_csv_grid(filename: &str) -> io::Result<(usize, usize, Vec<i32>)>
* Comma-separated elevation values
* Dynamic size detection
* Input validation and error handling
* Perfect for small test datasets
Binary Format 
fn read_bin_grid(filename: &str) -> io::Result<(usize, usize, Vec<i32>)>
* Fixed 6000Ã—4800 grid (standard DEM format)
* Little-endian i16 values
* Sea-level clamping (negative â†’ 0)
* Optimized for large real-world datasets

Algorithm Correctness
Peak Identification Verification
* 8-connectivity ensures no false peaks
* Boundary handling prevents array access errors
* Strict inequality (>) requirement for peak classification
Prominence Calculation Accuracy
* Processing points in elevation order ensures optimal cols
* Union-Find maintains connectivity correctly
* Highest peak gets prominence = elevation (connects to sea level)
Edge Case Handling
* Flat areas (no peaks detected correctly)
* Single peak (prominence = elevation)
* Boundary peaks (partial neighbor sets)
* Below sea-level areas (clamped to 0)

Implementation Highlights

// Memory Safety
let mut grid = Vec::with_capacity(total_points); // No buffer overflows

// Zero-Cost Abstractions  
points.sort(); // Custom Ord implementation, no runtime overhead

}
